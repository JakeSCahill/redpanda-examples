GitOps is a modern approach to managing and automating the deployment and provisioning process using Git as the single source of truth. It involves storing configuration files and deployment scripts in a Git repository, and then using automation tools to continuously monitor the repository for changes.

This example uses Flux to deploy the Redpanda Helm chart on a local Kubernetes cluster. Flux is a toolkit for GitOps with Kubernetes clusters that supports the following:

- *Version control for configurations*: You can track changes, collaborate, and revert to previous configurations if needed.
- *Drift detection and remediation*: Flux continuously monitors the Redpanda cluster's state. If discrepancies are detected, Flux automatically remediates them to bring the Redpanda cluster back to the desired state.
- *Collaboration and auditing*: Multiple team members can propose changes to Redpanda configurations through Git pull requests, enabling code reviews and discussions before changes are applied.

== Prerequisites

You must have the following:

- https://github.com/signup[A GitHub account].

- https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/#install-the-flux-cli[The Flux CLI]

- An understanding of the https://fluxcd.io/flux/concepts/[core concepts of Flux].

- At least version 1.24 of https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/[the kubectl CLI].
+
[,bash]
----
kubectl version --client
----
- At least version 3.6.0 of https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/[Helm].
+
[,bash]
----
helm version
----

- https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation[kind]

- https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Docker]

== Create a local Kubernetes cluster

Create one master and three worker nodes (one worker node for each Redpanda broker).

. Define a cluster in the `kind.yaml` configuration file:
+
```bash
cat <<EOF >kind.yaml
---
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
kind: Cluster
nodes:
  - role: control-plane
  - role: worker
  - role: worker
  - role: worker
EOF
```

. Create the Kubernetes cluster from the configuration file:
+
```bash
kind create cluster --config kind.yaml
```

== Run the example

Fork the `redpanda-examples` repository, and configure Flux to connect to your fork.

. Fork the https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda-examples[`redpanda-data/redpanda-examples`] repository on GitHub.

. Bootstrap Flux for your forked repository.
+
[NOTE]
====
Make sure to do the following:

- Provide Flux with your https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/bootstrap/github/#github-pat[GitHub personal access token (PAT)].
- Configure the `path` flag with the value `kubernetes/gitops`. This is the path where the example manifests are stored in the repository.
====
+
Here is an example of the bootstrap command:
+
[,bash]
----
flux bootstrap github \
  --token-auth \
  --owner=<github-username> \
  --repository=redpanda-examples \
  --branch=main \
  --path=./kubernetes/gitops \
  --personal
----
+
Replace `<github-username>` with your GitHub username.

The bootstrap script does the following:

. Creates a deploy token and saves it as a Kubernetes Secret
. Creates an empty GitHub project, if the project specified by `--repository` doesn't exist
. Generates Flux definition files for your project
. Commits the definition files to the specified branch
. Applies the definition files to your cluster
. Applies the manifests in `kubernetes/gitops` which deploy Redpanda and cert-manager

After you run the script, Flux is ready to manage itself and any other resources you add to the GitHub project at the specified path.

== Verify the deployment

To verify that the deployment was successful, check the status of the HelmRelease resource:

[,bash]
----
kubectl get helmrelease redpanda --namespace redpanda --watch
----

In a few minutes, you should see that the Helm install succeeded:

[.no-copy]
----
NAME       AGE     READY   STATUS
redpanda   3m23s   True    Helm install succeeded for release redpanda/redpanda.v1 with chart redpanda@5.7.5
----

== Manage updates

To update Redpanda, modify the `redpanda-helm-release.yaml` manifest in your Git repository. You can configure the Helm chart in the `spec.values` field. For a description of all available configurations, see the https://docs.redpanda.com/current/reference/k-redpanda-helm-spec/[Redpanda Helm Chart Specification].

When you push changes to GitHub, Flux automatically applies the updates to your Kubernetes cluster.

== Delete the cluster

To delete the Kubernetes cluster as well as all the Docker resources that kind created, run:

[,bash]
----
kind delete cluster
----
